Slide 1: Title Slide
MongoDB vs SQL: A Modern Database Comparison
Subtitle: Choosing the right database for your project

Slide 2: Overview
SQL Databases

Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)

Structured data with predefined schemas

Uses tables, rows, and columns

ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

MongoDB (NoSQL)

Document-oriented database

Schema-less, flexible JSON-like documents

Collections instead of tables

BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent)

Slide 3: Data Structure Comparison
Feature	SQL	MongoDB
Data Model	Tables with rows	Collections with JSON documents
Schema	Fixed schema required	Dynamic schema
Relationships	Joins with foreign keys	Embedded documents or references
Example	SELECT * FROM users	db.users.find({})
Slide 4: Performance & Scalability
SQL
✔️ Excellent for complex queries
✔️ Strong consistency
❌ Vertical scaling (hardware upgrade)
❌ Performance drops with large datasets

MongoDB
✔️ Horizontal scaling (sharding)
✔️ High performance for large datasets
✔️ Flexible for unstructured data
❌ No native joins (requires application logic)

Slide 5: Use Cases
Choose SQL When:

You need complex transactions (e.g., banking systems)

Data integrity is critical

Your data structure is stable and predictable

Choose MongoDB When:

You need fast prototyping and flexible schemas

Handling large volumes of unstructured data

Scaling horizontally is a priority (e.g., IoT, real-time analytics)

Final Verdict:
SQL → "Structured and reliable"
MongoDB → "Flexible and scalable"
